# black_box

## Features to add
- Grad mean, max.
- Grad variance for each itteration and each epoch.
- L1 and L2 norms of gradients.
- Check dead or close to dead neurons and setup threshold based network pruning.
- weight distribution overtime (weight updates and magnitudes overtime).
- Saturation in activation functions (percentage of neuron values saturated).
- variance across channels (accross a certain selected dimension).
- Check operation being performed (function graph). Create a separate activation wrapper?

## ETC
- Mean of each itteration is not added (for gradient graphs, L1 and L2 norms)
